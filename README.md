# This is a sudoku Puzzle solver

<p><small>Concepts used:</p>
<ol>
  <li>2 D array</li>
  <li>Backtracking Algorithm</li>
  <li>Recursion</li>
</ol>

<h2>To run this file, Open terminal and type this command: </h2>
<p><small>python solve_sudoku.py</p>

<h2>Why Backtracking Algorithm?</h2>
<p><small>Without this, and using Naive approach will take hours or even days to come up with solution due to it's time complexity which is </br><strong> O(n * m)</strong>
</br>where;</p>
<p><small>n = no. of possibilites for each square (1 to 9) </br>
           m = no. of blanks to be filled in the puzzle</p>
